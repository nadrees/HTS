# HackThisSite.org Programming Challenge 1

Contains my solution to the programming challenge 1.

Basic idea is to split each word in the wordlist.txt file in to it's individual characters and a count of how often each character appears. Apply the same counting function to the randomized words and then find the word in the list that contains the same counts for each character, and that is the original, unscrambled word.
